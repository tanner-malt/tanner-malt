- Hi, I’m Tanner McGrath, I'm a Cost Analyst.
- My technical interests are in AI, ML, Data Science, Automation, and Programming.
- A subset of this, that I want to get into is robotics.
- For a quick get to know me, I like anything physical, recently it's been snow boarding, rock climbing, and hiking! For rest I play video games, with Factorio, Foundry, and League of Legends being the top of that stack.
- In the future I want to study more in the medical field, and start studying how I can "optimize" my body to help me enjoy my lifestyle the most

- I like to study a lot! If you see anything pertaining to my interest please feel free to send it over
- My current focus is AI Automation, and full stack development.
- How to reach me tanner@tanner-mcgrath.me is my email, and my website is https://tanner-mcgrath.me/ where you can get to know me a little better.
